All the lessons are in the "Lessons" folder. Most of them are Jupyter notebooks so you will need jupyter installed. You can install jupyter by typing:
```
pip install jupyter
```
or if using conda
```
conda install jupyter
```
then you have to run the jupyter server inside the folder. You can do it by typing:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Now you can browse the files inside this repo. Open the "Lessons" folder and select the lesson you want to open.
